  aboutMe:
    "Hi there, I'm Dimas. For almost my entire professional career, I've been involved in the construction sector due to family heritage. I've managed teams for nearly 7 years in various environments, including construction sites, exhibition booths, and the steel industry. After being curious about programming for many years and being discouraged by the limited opportunities in construction, I'm now studying to become a full stack developer.",
